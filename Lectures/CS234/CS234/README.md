## My Solution to Assignments of CS234
This is my solution to three assignments of CS234.<br>
[CS234: Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://cs234.stanford.edu/) is
an interesting class, which teaches you what is the reinforcement learning:
 Learn to make good sequences of decisions. This class provides some basic knowledge and insights of cutting-edge research in reinforcement learning. More details are as follows:
* Define the key features of RL vs AI & other ML 
* Define MDP, POMDP, bandit, batch offline RL, online RL
* Describe the exploration vs exploitation challenge and compare and contrast 2 or more approaches
* Given an application problem (e.g. from computer vision, robotics, etc) decide if it should be formulated as a RL problem, if yes how to formulate, what algorithm (from class) is best suited to address, and justify an answer
* Implement several RL algorithms incl. a deep RL approach
* Describe multiple criteria for analyzing RL algorithms and evaluate algorithms on these metrics: e.g. regret, sample complexity, computational complexity, convergence, etc. 
* List at least two open challenges or hot topics in RL
******
**Note:** If you consult my source codes that you may want to incorporate into your algorithm or system, you should clearly cite references in your codes.
