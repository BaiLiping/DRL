# Projects

The project is really the centerpiece of this class. It is your opportunity to try out and see how to do research. We imposed *a lot of constraints*. They are due to the fact that we've seen many teams in the past delay things until the last minute and then run out of time. The constraints are there to nudge you (rather strongly) to get things done in time and to have a great project.

* We've seen students being slow to assemble a team. This is why
  there's a deadline. You must register a team and a tentative project
  by **February 5, 2019**. This counts **10%** of the score.
* We've seen students put off any meaningful research until the
  end. This is why there's a public midterm presentation on **March 5,
  2019**. This counts **20%** of the score. You must produce between 1
  and 2 pages of a document. Style files are [here](media/latex.zip)
* We've seen students not ask for advice from TAs. This is why you now
  must get signoff from your TA at least once before the final
  presentation. You need to meet them at least once, at the latest in
  the week of **April 22-25, 2019**. This counts **10%** of the score.
* Project presentations are due on **May 7 and 9, 2019**. We picked
  two days to ensure that there's enough time for everyone to present
  their stuff.
* The written project report counts **40%** and it needs to have at
  least 6 pages using the same [style file](media/latex.zip). The
  upper page limit is 20, including appendix, details, etc.; This is
  to protect the TAs from going crazy with reviewing and grading.
* The presentation counts **20%** of the project. You need to have 6 slides in your presentation.

This is a *teamwork* effort and *you must form a team*. The project
contributes the lion's share to your grades. We will take the number
of team members into account in the evaluation (i.e. a great three
student project is probably not going to be such an impressive five
student project). All team members will receive the same score (it's
too difficult for us to assess fairly who contributed how much based
on possibly contradicting statements). So choose wisely who you work
with.

You will be expected to provide a report describing the project in the
end. It should describe your work in a reproducible manner, i.e. in
enough detail that someone competent could take the report and
regenerate the results (after some work but no guesswork) reliably.
