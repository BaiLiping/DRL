To check the variance we use $\\mathbf{E}[(x-\\mu)^2] = \\sigma^2$ and thus the transformed variable has unit variance. The reason for 'normalizing' the data is that it brings all features to the same order of magnitude. After all, we do not know *a priori* which features are likely to be relevant.
