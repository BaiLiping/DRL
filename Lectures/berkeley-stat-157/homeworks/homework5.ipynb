    "Your goal is to introduce covariate shit in the data and observe the accuracy. For this, compose a dataset of $12,000$ observations, given by a mixture of `sneaker` and `pullover` and of `sandal` and `shirt` respectively, where you use a fraction $\\lambda \\in \\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, \\ldots 0.8, 0.9, 0.95\\}$ of one and a fraction of $1-\\lambda$ of  the other datasets respectively. For instance, you might pick for $\\lambda = 0.1$ a total of $600$ `sneaker` and $5,400$ `pullover` images and likewise $600$ `sandal` and $5,400$ `shirt` photos, yielding a total of $12,000$ images for training. Note that the test set remains unbiased, composed of $2,000$ photos for the `sneaker` + `pullover` category and of the `sandal` + `shirt` category each.\n",

    "Having observed that covariate shift can be harmful, let's try fixing it. For this we first need to compute the appropriate propensity scores $\\frac{dp(x)}{dq(x)}$. For this purpose pick a biased dataset, let's say with $\\lambda = 0.1$ and try to fix the covariate shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When training a logistic regression binary classifier to fix covariate shift, we assumed so far that both sets are of equal size. Show that re-weighting data in training and test set appropriately can help address the issue when both datasets have different size. What is the weighting?\n",
    "2. Train a binary classifier (using logistic regression) distinguishing between the biased training set and the unbiased test set. Note - you need to weigh the data. \n",
    "3. Use the scores to compute weights on the training set. Do they match the weight arising from the biasing distribution $\\lambda$? \n",
    "4. Train a binary classifier of the covariate shifted problem using the weights obtained previously and report the accuracy. Note - you will need to modify the training loop slightly such that you can compute the gradient of a weighted sum of losses. \n"
