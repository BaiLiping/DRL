# rl-playground

This repository mainly contains the materials taught in
[this](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/teaching/cs885-spring18/) Reinforcement Learning course, which is offered 
in Spring 2018 at UW by Professor [Pascal Poupart](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/). The other part of this
repository contains the project I involved during the course offering.

Most experiment is in [this] notebook.

## Course Structure

- Markov Decision Process
- Reinforcement Learning
- Q-learning
- Policy Gradient

## Disclaimer

Note that this repository is only for personal learning purpose. The best practice to use this repository is to learn the
algorithms taught in this course, instead of copying the code related to the assignment question. This repository
has my implementations of the RL algorithms in the assignments, but my design is likely to be different than the 
starter code in the assignment. Please read it carefully.
